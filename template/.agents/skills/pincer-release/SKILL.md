# $pincer-release — Workflow Audit

You are auditing the current repo state against `docs/release-checklist.md`. Read-only:
report pass/fail, never fix anything — fixes belong to the stage commands. Release does
not repair tickets, rewrite evidence, change PRD state, or publish. A check that mutates
the candidate invalidates the audit: if `git status --short` is not empty afterwards,
the verdict is FAIL and names the mutation. The verdict is reported to the user; a
durable runtime-owned release record is later work.

**Requested stage:** the text that follows the `$pincer-release` mention, if any (when omitted, use the playbook's documented default)

## Steps

1. Read `docs/release-checklist.md` — it is the source of truth for product-candidate
   readiness. `docs/dry-run-checklist.md` is a separate manual platform trial and must
   not impose toy-project or Pincer-kit assumptions on this audit.
2. Run `scripts/pincer-status.sh` to determine the selected PRD and which stages have run
   (it reads `.prd/`, associated `tickets/`, `NOTES.md`; add `git log`). If `the text that follows the `$pincer-release` mention, if any (when omitted, use the playbook's documented default)`
   names a stage, check only up
   to that stage.
3. Check every applicable item mechanically where possible:
   - File existence and frontmatter: read the files.
   - Commit format and story: `git log --oneline`.
   - Receipts: every done ticket is ready — on a legacy project current `last_check`
     and `verified` receipts, on a migrated project a current passing attempt
     (`node scripts/pincer-runtime.cjs ready` exits 0); any status warning fails the
     audit. Do not call `pincer-ticket.sh` from Release:
     it writes receipts and would invalidate the evaluated candidate. Release never
     runs `verify`, `check` or `done`; `status`, `ready` and the project gate are its
     only commands.
   - Evidence: `scripts/pincer-status.sh` runs the shared validator
     (`scripts/pincer-evidence.cjs`) against the manifest `NOTES.md` names. The `Notes`
     line must read `current` and the `Evidence` line `ok`; any other text fails the
     audit with that diagnostic. Do not re-implement evidence checks and do not accept
     screenshots described in chat: read the manifest's `checks`, requirement
     dispositions and `visual_review`. Validation establishes that the record is
     consistent, not that the commands ran — say so if asked.
   - Provenance: status prints a `Provenance` line for the evaluated candidate:
     `runtime (schema 2)` with local attempts consistent, or `legacy (schema 1, authored
     command results)`. A newer local attempt that failed, timed out, was interrupted or
     is still running for the same check and source inputs fails the audit (`ready`
     exits 1 and names the check). A fresh clone reports `local verification history
     unavailable; saved candidate evidence validated only`: state that limit in the
     verdict rather than claiming local verification.
   - Change records (the `Runtime` line reads `changes`): the selected change is
     `completed`, its authorization is `current` for the current agreement, and its
     evaluation locator `.prd/evidence/changes/<id>.json` names the evaluated
     candidate; `node scripts/pincer-runtime.cjs ready` reports `SELECTION_REQUIRED`,
     `LIFECYCLE_BLOCKED`, `DECISION_REQUIRED`, `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` or
     `AGREEMENT_CHANGED` as failures. Release selects, activates and completes nothing;
     historical evidence of a cancelled or superseded change is inspectable but never
     release-ready.
   - Every file the manifest lists is tracked, and `git status --short` is empty before
     and after the audit.
   - Run the repository's candidate-wide release gate directly (`npm test`, or the
     equivalent declared by the project) and report its actual output. Any failure
     blocks PASS. Confirm `git status --short` remains clean afterward.
4. For judgment items (tickets genuinely S/M, history reads as a story), give your
   verdict AND one sentence of evidence — never a bare pass.
5. Present a table: checklist item | pass/fail/skipped | evidence. Order by stage.
6. End with a one-line verdict naming the candidate: "PASS — candidate {sha}: workflow
   artifacts complete" or "FAIL — candidate {sha}: {n} items failed; fix via {command}".
   Fixes go through a new ticket, a new candidate and a new evaluation. For each failure, name the command
   file (`.claude/commands/*.md`) whose instructions should be tightened if the
   failure is a workflow bug rather than a run mistake.
