# /pincer-plan — PRD Creation

You are turning a task brief into a reviewable PRD. Scale discovery and detail to
the change's uncertainty, risk, and any time budget the user supplied. The PRD feeds
`/pincer-narrow` next.

Choose the planning profile and record why it fits: `profile: small` for bounded
scope, low risk, known behavior and straightforward verification; otherwise
`standard` (the default). Few changed lines alone do not qualify — migrations,
authorization boundaries, uncertain requirements and broad effects need proper
investigation even for a tiny patch. Honor an explicit budget the user supplied;
there is no default timebox, and a budget never silently cuts requirements —
record any cut in Out of Scope.

**Initial request:** $ARGUMENTS

First run `scripts/pincer-status.sh`. If a PRD already exists, preserve it and select
the next unused numeric version for this change. Use the brief and repository state to
distinguish a revision from a new change; ask only if that distinction changes scope or
architecture. If tickets for the current PRD are in progress, resume `/pincer-code`
unless the user explicitly authorized a separate change.

## Phase 1: Discovery

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains the brief, extract what you can before asking anything.
   Never ask a question the brief already answers. Preserve or link the original
   brief in the PRD, and record the desired outcome, assumptions and exclusions.
   If the user supplied a PRD, review it: keep its meaning and existing requirement
   IDs; do not silently replace either. Where its structure needs adapting to the
   template, record a mapping table (`their section or ID → R-NN`) inside the PRD.
2. Ask only the questions whose answers would change the architecture or scope.
   Batch them (max 3–4 at once). A question the brief partly answers is
   asked only for its open part, naming the settled part; when the brief settles
   every material decision, including acceptance behavior, ask no discovery
   question and record the brief's answers. Do not add a question to fill the budget.
   Typical ones:
   - What does "done" look like — what will be run, demoed, or reviewed at the end?
     A named test runner settles the verification choice, not every acceptance
     behavior; ask about the demo or manual check only if that is still open.
   - Any required stack, or is it my choice?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?
3. If the project has a frontend, ask one design question: "What should this feel like,
   and what should it NOT look like?" Capture the answer for the Visual Direction section.
   The same rule applies: when the brief already supplies design direction, record it
   and ask only about what it leaves open.

Summarize your understanding in 3–5 sentences. Existing authorization in the request or
session carries forward; ask only about an unresolved choice that materially changes the result.

## Phase 2: Codebase scan (conditional)

If the repo already contains source code, launch 1–2 `codebase-explorer` agents in parallel
(one for architecture/structure, one for patterns relevant to the feature). Read the 2–3 most
load-bearing files they identify yourself — don't rely solely on agent summaries. If the
repo is empty, skip and say so. (No subagents on this platform? Do the exploration
yourself, inline, following the rules in `.claude/agents/codebase-explorer.md`.)

**Brownfield scaling:** if the existing code is substantial or load-bearing (production
traffic, other consumers, no green test suite), this phase grows and Phase 4 shrinks —
a wrong map costs more than a thin PRD. Additionally establish: which paths the change
touches are load-bearing, what test coverage protects them (run the suite, don't assume),
and the blast radius + rollback story for the change. Record these in the PRD's
Architecture section. Greenfield speed assumptions do not transfer to brownfield work.

## Phase 3: Architecture

Propose the architecture: components, data flow, integration points, and key decisions.
- Recommend one approach; mention an alternative only when the trade-off is real.
- Name the trust boundaries in one or two sentences: which inputs are untrusted
  (user input, LLM output, third-party responses), where each is validated, and
  which secrets exist and where they live (server-side only). This becomes the
  PRD's Security section when the project handles secrets or external input.
- Verify versions of key dependencies with `npm view <pkg> version` (or the ecosystem's
  equivalent) before naming them — don't trust training data.
- Verify the contract of any external API the plan builds on (one live request or the
  current official docs) before designing around it — endpoint shapes remembered from
  training data are guesses.
- Respect any explicit delivery budget. Record deliberate cuts in Out of Scope.

Prepare the full draft before seeking any approval still required. The user should review a
concrete scope and architecture; do not repeat an approval already given for the same decision.

## Phase 4: Write the PRD

1. Load `.claude/references/prd-template.md` and write all core sections.
   In Requirements, assign stable `R-NN` IDs within the selected PRD: a revision
   keeps existing IDs and adds new ones, never renumbers. Every requirement has
   observable acceptance scenarios, the relevant failure paths, and the existing
   behavior it must preserve — `/pincer-narrow` maps each scenario to a ticket and
   a check, and `/pincer-evaluate` dispositions every ID.
2. Include optional sections when risk or the product context warrants them.
3. Save to the next unused `.prd/prd-v{N}.md` (create `.prd/` if needed), with `N`
   matching the filename and frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   version: {N}
   status: draft
   date: {today}
   profile: small   # only when small; omit for standard
   ---
   ```
4. If `.git/` doesn't exist, run `git init`. Commit the PRD and only the intended setup
   paths after inspecting existing staged work; planning should be visible in history
   without absorbing unrelated brownfield changes.

Present the saved draft and obtain approval only when the same scope/architecture was not
already authorized. Finish with: "PRD saved to `.prd/prd-v{N}.md`. Run `/pincer-narrow`
to break it into work items."

## Authorization rule (shared by plan, narrow, code and evaluate)

Reuse explicit authorization for the same scope and decisions; ask only about a
material choice not already authorized, and prepare the concrete proposal before
asking. A decision the user delegated (for example "pick the architecture") does not
need another approval when you exercise it, but a newly discovered consequential
choice is surfaced before implementation. Record the authorization basis and the
scope it covers in the PRD or the handover, and on a project with change records as
a `change authorize` record (the user's words as the excerpt, or a `--delegated`
disposition with its basis). An agent-written record or a status
field is not authenticated human approval. When resuming without the context that
granted authorization, do not invent it — read the `resume` report; an authorization
it reports as `current` needs no repeat approval, and any other verdict is asked.
